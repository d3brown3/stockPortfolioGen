## Stock Portfolio Generator

#### Goal: Purpose of this project is to demonstrate skills in python and make some $$$ by generating balanced portfolio of stocks with upside potential based on momentum and value.

#### Method #1:
1. Scrape yahoo finance historical data, current data, and possibly news data (for sentiment).
2. Develop RNN to capture trend/momentum, incorporate financial data, and sentiment (maybe).
3. Develop optimal portfolio given constraints of capital (retail investor) and sensitivity to change in drivers (earnings performance).

#### Method #2:
1. Use reinforcement learning to constantly buy and sell stocks as they go up and down (maybe this has rnn as base model that it adapts to based on costs/constraints/etc).

#### Method #3.
1. Create random portfolio, randomizing on a criteria or two (sector, size, etc).
